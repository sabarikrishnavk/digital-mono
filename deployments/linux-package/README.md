# Linux Package Manager Configuration

This directory is intended for scripts and configuration files to package applications from this monorepo for Linux distributions (e.g., as `.deb` or `.rpm` packages).

This might be used for:

- A CLI tool (e.g., built from `cmd/digital-mono-cli`).
- Any other distributable application derived from this monorepo.

Placeholder for packaging scripts (e.g., using `goreleaser`, `fpm`, or native packaging tools).
